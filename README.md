# Simple xdotool example

## Description
This is just a minimal example to use the xdotool library.

It searches for gedit, and prints "HELLOWORLD" 5 times and then erases it.

## To run
`sh run.sh`

The run.sh shows an example of opening gedit remotely and typing in text. This
allows xdotool to work over ssh.
